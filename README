The package I used to manipulate bit strings is "python-bitstring"
http://code.google.com/p/python-bitstring/
The package I used for crypt is "PyCrypto"

first write commands to "in.txt", each line represents one command
then execute this command in beocat
qsub -l mem=4G,h_rt=20:00:00 -pe single 1 cis753_PA1.sh
finally you will get output from "out.txt"
